# Project-2---hello-world-
Hypothesis: If humans and birds are both endothermic even though their most recent ancestor was cold-blooded, there could there be genomic evidence present that could prove convergent evolution in the form of similar transcription factors, pathways and expression levels.
scientific question: scientific question: Are there shared transcription factors or pathways or expression levels that could serve as genomic evidence for convergent evolution of endothermy in birds and humans?
In this project, we have four different files. One is the untitled6 files which are the first draft for this project. In this there is a self grading portion where I go through the rubric to graed myself. 
There is also human.tsv and crow.tsv. These are the fasta files which contain the data on the TLRs which we will analyze.
